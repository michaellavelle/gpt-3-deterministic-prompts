# gpt-3-deterministic-prompts

A repository for suggestions from GPT-3 prompts where the output should be deterministic (ie. temperature = 0.0 )

I don't have access to the GPT-3 API as of yet - this repository is a place to store future ideas for prompts I'd like to test against the API.

If you have suggestions for prompts you'd like to suggest, or you have the actual output for a deterministic prompt that has already been run against the GPT-3 API,  please feel free to raise a PR.

Once the outputs for the prompts in this repository are determined ( when run against the API), this repository will be updated to contain the known output,  and will automatically get pulled into the gpt-3-mock-api project
